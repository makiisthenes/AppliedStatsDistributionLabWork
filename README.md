Use of modelling stochastic events, into distributions, and calculating metrics for centrality and dispersion, also understanding the use of (one/two) headed hypothesis testing which are based on statistics, i.e CTL, LLN to test based on alpha confidence values. Distribution parameter fitting, and visualization of singular and multivariate distributions.
